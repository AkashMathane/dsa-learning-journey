# DSA Foundations 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms
from first principles.

### Goals
- Build strong problem-solving foundations
- Understand algorithms, not memorize them
- Practice explaining solutions clearly
- Prepare for technical interviews

### Learning Approach
- Topic-wise learning
- Pattern-based problem-solving
- Reflection after every problem
- Time & space complexity analysis

### Progress
- ✅ Sorting Algorithms (In Progress)
- ⏳ Binary Search
- ⏳ Arrays & Strings
- ⏳ Trees, Graphs, DP

# 📘 DSA Fast-Track Learning Plan (No Burnout)

This README defines **how to complete the DSA course quickly and correctly**  
without burning out or forgetting everything.

---

## 🎯 GOAL

- Finish the entire DSA course **efficiently**
- Build **strong foundations**
- Avoid rewatching, guilt, and burnout
- Be interview-ready after second pass

---

## 🧠 CORE PRINCIPLES (READ THIS FIRST)

1. **Do NOT binge-watch videos**
2. **Do NOT aim for mastery in first pass**
3. **One clean pass > multiple messy passes**
4. **Patterns matter more than memorization**
5. **Burnout = too much input, too little compression**

---

## ⏱️ DAILY TIME LIMIT

- **Max: 2.5–3 hours/day**
- Never exceed this (important)

---

## 🔁 DAILY LEARNING LOOP (MANDATORY)

Every study day follows this exact loop:

### 1️⃣ WATCH (90–120 mins max)
- Watch videos at **1.25x–1.5x**
- Pause only for:
  - New algorithm
  - New design strategy
- Do NOT over-note

---

### 2️⃣ COMPRESS (20 mins)
Write **compression notes only**:

- Algorithm name
- Core idea (2 lines)
- Time complexity
- When to use

❌ No code  
❌ No long explanations  

---

### 3️⃣ APPLY (30 mins)
- Code **ONE representative algorithm only**
- Use pseudocode
- No perfection
- No optimization

Purpose: muscle memory, not mastery

---

### 4️⃣ RETAIN (15–20 mins)
- Dry-run one algorithm OR
- Solve 1 easy/known problem OR
- Re-read compression notes

---

## 🗓️ WEEKLY RHYTHM (ANTI-BURNOUT)

### Monday – Friday
- Full daily loop

### Saturday
- Light revision
- Re-read notes
- No heavy coding

### Sunday
- OFF (important)
- Zero guilt
