# DSA Foundations 🚀

This repository documents my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms
from first principles.

### Goals
- Build strong problem-solving foundations
- Understand algorithms, not memorize them
- Practice explaining solutions clearly
- Prepare for technical interviews

### Learning Approach
- Topic-wise learning
- Pattern-based problem-solving
- Reflection after every problem
- Time & space complexity analysis

### Progress
- ✅ Sorting Algorithms (In Progress)
- ⏳ Binary Search
- ⏳ Arrays & Strings
- ⏳ Trees, Graphs, DP
